======================

> We've released! [v1.4.6](https://github.com/clockbyte/admobadapter/releases/tag/v1.4.6)! The support of express ads has been dropped, please use banners instead ([see details](https://github.com/clockbyte/admobadapter/issues/105)).

The reference to the [COOK RECIPES](https://github.com/clockbyte/admobadapter/wiki/Cookbook) for people who are in hurry!

Admob Adapter is an Android library that makes it easy to integrate [Admob native ads](https://firebase.google.com/docs/admob/android/native) (both Express and Advanced) or AdMob banners into ```ListView/RecyclerView``` in the way that is shown in the following image/animation.
